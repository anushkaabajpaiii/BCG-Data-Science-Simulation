#PowerCo Churn Prediction - Data Science Project

#Project Overview

PowerCo, an energy provider, is experiencing customer churn. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier. By analyzing historical customer data and pricing trends, we identify factors influencing churn and evaluate model performance using multiple metrics.

#Dataset Information

The project uses the following datasets :

client_data.csv - Historical customer data including electricity consumption, contract details, and churn status.

price_data.csv - Variable and fixed pricing details.

data_for_predictions.csv - Preprocessed dataset for modeling.

#Project Workflow

Data Exploration & Cleaning

Checked for missing values, outliers, and data types.

Visualized distributions and correlations.

Feature Engineering

Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., ID).

Created relevant features for model training.

Model Training & Evaluation

Implemented a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Insights & Next Steps

Identified key churn drivers.

Suggested improvements for model performance.
